# house-price-prediction
Abstract — We propose to implement a house price prediction model of Bangalore, India. It’s a Machine
Learning model which integrates Data Science and Web Development. We have deployed the app on the Heroku
Cloud Application Platform. Housing prices fluctuate on a daily basis and are sometimes exaggerated rather than
based on worth. The major focus of this project is on predicting home prices using genuine factors. Here, we
intend to base an evaluation on every basic criterion that is taken into account when establishing the pricing.
The goal of this project is to learn Python and get experience in Data Analytics, Machine Learning

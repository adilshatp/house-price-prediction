# house-price-prediction
Abstract — We propose to implement a house price prediction model of Bangalore, India. It’s a Machine
Learning model which integrates Data Science and Web Development. We have deployed in stream lit. Housing 
prices fluctuate on a daily basis and are sometimes exaggerated rather thanbased on worth. The major focus
of this project is on predicting home prices using genuine factors. Here, weintend to base an evaluation on 
every basic criterion that is taken into account when establishing the pricing.The goal of this project is to
learn Python and get experience in Data Analytics, Machine Learning
